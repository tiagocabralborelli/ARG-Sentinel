Antimicrobial resistance is one of the most threats of our century. In the next decades, non-treatable bacterial infections will take thousands of lives over the world. Thus, scientists have been working on ways to developt/find novel antibiotics as well as surveillance strategies. This is my and my colleagues' contribution to understanding how antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) spread.
